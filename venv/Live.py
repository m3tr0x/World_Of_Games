# welcome(name) - This function gets a person name as an input and returns a welcome string.
# load_game() - This function:
# 1. Will print out the game selection text
# 2. Will get an input from the user about the game he chose â€“ 1/2.
# 3. After receiving the game number from the user, the function will get the level of difficulty from 1 to 5
# 4. Will start a new function of the corresponding game with the given difficulty.
# The function will check the input of the chosen game (the input supposed to be a number
# between 1 to 2), also will check the input of level of difficulty (input should be a number between
# 1 to 5).
# In case of an invalid choice, return the ERROR_MESSAGE (Utils.py).
# In case the user won the game, the function will call the function called add_score() (in score.py
# module) to add the new score the user won to the score saved in the Scores.txt function.
# In case the user lost, call load_game() again.
